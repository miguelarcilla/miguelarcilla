## Introduction

Microsoft offers industry-leading platforms for partners to build and sell value-added IP, and with rapidly growing commercial marketplaces in [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/) and [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/), it's easier than ever for users to discover, purchase, and activate solutions that build on Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and even Copilot!

[Marketplace Rewards](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/isv/Marketplace-Rewards) is an incentive program that provides Microsoft partners selling through the marketplace with a suite of perks that accelerate growth, close more deals, and encourage consistent innovation and co-selling.

In this post, we'll discuss the benefits, what's new, and how to get started with Marketplace Rewards.

## Marketplace Rewards: What's in it for me?

**Once a Microsoft Partner has published a solution on the Marketplace, they become eligible for Marketplace Rewards, and as these published solutions mature and grow in revenue, new benefits are unlocked.**

*Contactable listings* (solutions advertised, but not purchased, through the marketplace) gain 6 months of marketing-related benefits, including mentions in the Commercial marketplace blog, access to a self-serve marketing toolkit, and listing optimization guidance. While it is a good start, and helps achieve baseline [Co-Sell Ready requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/referrals/co-sell-requirements#requirements-for-co-sell-ready-status) (a must when working with Microsoft field sales teams), it is just the tip of the iceberg.

*Transactable listings* are where the real fun begins.

With transactable offers, partners gain access to seriously scalable perks, including Azure sponsorships for POCs and trial sandboxes, solution spotlights highlighting your offer internally to Microsoft field sales, and elevated publicity with featured blog posts and executive endorsements.
