## Introduction

The GitHub Advanced Security (GH-500) certification tests your knowledge and skills in securing software development workflows using GitHub’s advanced security tools. 

I've taken GitHub exams in the past and felt relatively confident, given my background in DevOps platforms and tools. GitHub's security platform, however, was quite new to me, making this one of the exams for which I was most nervous. Thankfully I passed on my first try, and in this post, I’ll share some of resources that helped me prepare for GH-500, as well as some tips to get you GitHub Certified.

## Recommended Study Resources
### Microsoft Learn
Self-paced learning site that covers almost all of Microsoft's extensive catalog of products and services. Many of the courses here provide virtual sandboxes or lab guides to get hands-on experience with a new product; for GitHub, exercises are performed in live GitHub repositories that let you perform the tasks in a real environment!

**[Study guide for GH-500: GitHub Advanced Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/gh-500)** - Read through the skills measured and how you can mentally allot your study time/capacity.

**[Learning Path: GitHub Advanced Security Part 1 of 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/github-advanced-security/)** - Covers the foundations of Secret Scanning, Code Scanning, and Dependabot.

**[Learning Path: GitHub Advanced Security Part 2 of 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/github-advanced-security-2)** - Goes deeper into setting up and using CodeQL, as well as administering GitHub Advanced Security

### aka.ms/practicetest
Have this one bookmarked, because it contains assessments for almost every Microsoft exam. 

**[Practice Assessment for GH-500: GitHub Advanced Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/github-advanced-security/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=590484996&practice-assessment-type=certification)** - 30 multiple choice questions that simulate the format you'll see on the test. 

*Note: I found some of the questions to be a bit repetitive and simple, so this particular assessment has room to improve*

### GH Certified community tests
This is not an official Microsoft tool, but an open source repository of sample questions from GitHub enthusiasts around the world.

**[GitHub Advanced Security Practice Test](https://ghcertified.com/practice_tests/advanced_security/)** - This was really useful, as the questions here most closely reflected what I saw on the test. The only caveat is that there are over 140 questions in the assessment, and (as far as I know) no way to skip ahead or see your progress aside from clicking to the end. Take this if you like testing marathons!

**[Schedule your online exam through Pearson Vue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/schedule-through-pearson-vue?examUid=exam.GH-500&examUrl=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fcredentials%2Fcertification) when you feel ready and give it your best shot!**

Tips and Tricks
•	Focus on Key Topics:
•	Prioritize areas like code scanning, secret scanning, and security workflow automation, as these feature heavily on the exam.
•	Get Hands-On:
•	Create a test repository and enable advanced security features. Practice configuring code scanning rules, reviewing security alerts, and interpreting scan results.
•	Time Management:
•	During the exam, don’t dwell too long on tough questions. Mark them for review and move on—come back if you have time.
•	Stay Updated:
•	GitHub regularly updates its security features. Check for recent changes in documentation before your exam date.
