## Introduction

David Epstein’s [*Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World*](https://davidepstein.com/range/) challenges the conventional wisdom that specialization is the key to success. While prodigies like Tiger Woods set the example of choosing a field early and focusing exclusively and intensely on becoming the best, such success stories are few and far between, and trying to follow the same model can lead to pressuring oneself to pursue specializations before trulying know who we are.

Instead, adopting a ["Roger Federer" model](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/sport/article/range-david-epstein), curiously dabbling in multiple fields (in his case, sports) to find where one's interests and capabilities intersect, can feel like lost time during the exploration phase, but often results in accelerated growth and progress once that fit is realized.

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly prevalent in our workflows and tools, the book’s insights on embracing breadth, adaptability, and lateral thinking feel more relevant than ever. As a technology professional at Microsoft, I feel empowered to be curious and build technical breadth in addition to my specialized areas, but the core message of *Range* has encouraged me to take this even further, expanding breadth across domains and considering AI tools both as a competitor against which to re-evaluate my skillsets, as well as an enabler to help me build new ones. 

In this post, I reflect on five lessons learned reading *Range*, and how they can help modern professionals thrive as generalists in an AI-accelerated world.

## **Takeaway 1:** AI can be a competent specialist in a kind environment, but human ingenuity is essential in broad, wicked domains

![AlphaGo is an example of an AI system that applies machine learning techniques to excel in a kind domain like Go. Picture from https://deepmind.google/research/projects/alphago/](/assets/images/2025-10-7-David-Epstein-Range-Review-AI/alphago.webp)

Epstein argues that in complex, unpredictable environments ("wicked domains"), generalists outperform specialists. Drawing on examples from sports, science, and business, he shows that those who sample widely, cultivate diverse experiences, and connect ideas across genres are better equipped to solve novel problems. 

In this regard, we can consider AI as a hyper-specialist, excelling at learning in "kind" environments with clear rules, feedback, and outcomes (like chess or Go). However, its tendencies to hallucinate and be confidently ignorant mean that it still struggles in wicked domains, where problems are ambiguous and solutions require creativity. 

This represents an opportunity for people to expand the scope of issues they address, allowing AI to competently manage kind problems while tackling broader issues and systems. A good example of this is how teams can use AI programming tools to build unit tests on discrete pieces of code, allowing them to focus attention on deploying the app environment as a whole.

## **Takeaway 2:** AI is getting better at wicked problems; we must expand the domain 

![Models like Researcher and Analyst are challenging what we previously considered to be human-exclusive thought. Picture from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing-researcher-and-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot/?msockid=199a3d1800c5654634e3293d01a064f8](/assets/images/2025-10-7-David-Epstein-Range-Review-AI/researcher.png)

That said, AI is advancing rapidly, encroaching on tasks once thought to require human intuition. Two such examples of this are the [Researcher and Analyst agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing-researcher-and-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot/?msockid=199a3d1800c5654634e3293d01a064f8), which can analyze vast amounts of information and data to produce insights and strategies that cover several fields. While there is still a risk of hallucination in ambiguous scenarios, Analyst and Researcher highlight the pace of growth in this field.

However, as AI becomes more capable, this means that the boundaries of wicked domains shift. By challenging ourselves to expand our range even further, professionals can elevate their executive thinking to areas where human judgment, empathy, and creativity are still indispensable. This requires a curiosity + growth mindset, as well as allowing ourselves to have greater sampling periods.

## **Takeaway 3:** Sampling is essential to growth, and AI aids in exploration

Embracing "sampling periods", allowing ourselves time to try totally new things before settling on a path, resonates in the AI era. In fact, AI assistants like Copilot can be powerful guides when quickly exploring new fields where a coach would previously be needed, lowering the barrier to entry in that specific domain. In this case, AI becomes a partner in exploration, not just a competitor.

One way I've used AI to practice sampling is in the field of finance. I recently set a goal for myself to build a diversified investment portfolio, and Copilot has been my coach in learning about investment instruments, evaluating individual companies for stock growth, and comparing funds to limit overlaps.

Being a "deliberate amateur" allows us to pivot and adapt as opportunities arise.

## **Takeaway 4:** Lateral thinking enables practical innovation amidst unprecedented tech advancement

Generalists excel at lateral thinking—connecting ideas across domains to spark innovation. Epstein cites examples like Nintendo’s Gunpei Yokoi, who leveraged “lateral thinking with withered technology” to create breakthrough products. In today’s world, where AI accelerates technological change, the ability to recombine old and new ideas is crucial. Generalists who cultivate broad networks and diverse experiences are best positioned to innovate.

## **Takeaway 5:** Learn to Drop Familiar Tools to truly embrace the AI era

Epstein warns against the “cult of the head start”—the tendency to cling to familiar tools and approaches. In the AI era, adaptability is key. Sometimes, progress requires letting go of expertise and embracing uncertainty. Generalists are comfortable with ambiguity and willing to unlearn and relearn as needed. This mindset is essential for thriving alongside AI, which constantly reshapes the landscape.

---

## Conclusion

*Range* offers a compelling case for embracing breadth, curiosity, and adaptability—qualities that are increasingly vital as AI transforms work and learning. By cultivating range, you can forge a resilient, innovative career path and thrive as a generalist in a world where change is the only constant.
